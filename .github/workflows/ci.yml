# This workflow runs automatically on:
# - Push to main/master branches
# - Pull requests (including from forks) - no manual approval needed
# - Manual trigger via workflow_dispatch
#
# Security notes:
# - Uses pull_request_target to auto-run for fork PRs without approval
# - Explicitly checks out PR code via head.sha for safety
# - Credentials are not persisted to prevent token leakage
