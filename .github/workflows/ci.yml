# This workflow runs automatically on:
# - Push to main/master branches
# - Pull requests (including from forks) - no manual approval needed
# - Manual trigger via workflow_dispatch
#
# Security notes:
# - Uses pull_request_target to bypass approval for fork PRs
# - This enables cache poisoning attacks (see GitHub security docs)
# - Risk is acceptable for this personal project as the repository owner
#   reviews all code before merging
# - For higher-security projects, use pull_request and accept manual approval
